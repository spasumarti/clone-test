> Websites are critically important for a business because they create a positive or negative impression of your products, goods, services…image of your brand. And as we know websites are visited even though the actual purchase can be made in store. Therefore, a website should be user-friendly, intuitive, and easy to navigate. Moreover, it should be optimized for various kinds of mobile devices and site traffic. But quite often in the process of putting up a website, we’re so busy focusing on the big stuff like design, content, and digital marketing that we forget one of the most fundamental parts of keeping that business site operational and fast: website performance optimization. Actually, speed is a critical element of running a successful website and should always be a priority for website managers. Faster loading websites benefit from better user engagement, higher conversion rates, higher SEO rankings and much more.
