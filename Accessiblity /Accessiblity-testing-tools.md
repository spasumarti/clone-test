## Testing Tools

Here are some tools and practices you can start using to make your websites more accessible for people with hearing, visual, physical, and cognitive disabilities.

### Best Practices

### Ways to test:

### No hearing: 

most deaf or hard-of-hearing people have limited difficulty with web accessibility, but make sure that any pieces of audio or video have captions or a text-based script.

### No mouse: 

many users with limited mobility can only interact with the screen via keyboard. Other users use a mouse, but have trouble with fine motor control. Try using only your keyboard to navigate the website you are working. (Utilize the Tab, Enter, Space, and Arrow Keys).

### No sight: 

test your website with a screenreader. Chrome Vox, JAWS, VoiceOver, NVDA are all acceptable.

### Low or tunnel vision: 

try zooming in on your designs to see how they look when enlarged. Additionally, use some of the color and contrast tools we have linked to in order to make sure all of your ratios are adequate.

### Cognitive disability:

Design and write your websites simply, consistently, and clearly. See our section on cognitive disabilities for more information.

## How to Use Screenreaders & Shortcuts

Here is a brief guide on how to use three screenreaders: Chrome Vox, NVDA, and iOS VoiceOver.

### Chrome Vox Short Cuts
Control + Command = Chrome Vox Key
Chrome Vox + AA = Activate/Deactive Chrome Vox Extension

### Basic Navigation
Chrome Vox + Down = Navigate forward
Chrome Vox + Up = Navigate backward
Chrome Vox + Right = Navigate forward at more detailed level
Chrome Vox + Left = Navigate backward at more detailed level
Enter = Activate current item, go to link
Space = Activate current item, go to link
Tab = Jump to next focusable item
Tab + Shift = Jump to previous focusable item

### More Complex

Chrome Vox + N + H = Jump to next heading
Chrome Vox + P + H = Jump to previous heading
Chrome Vox + N + L = Jump to next link
Chrome Vox + P + L = Jump to previous link

### NVDA Short Cuts

Insert = NVDA Key
NVDA + Q = Quit NVDA
Basic Navigation
Down = Say next line
Up = Say prior line
Tab = Jump to next focusable item
Shift + Tab = Jump to previous focusable item

### More Complex

H = Headings quick key
V = Visited link quick key
U = Unvisited link quick key
NVDA + F7 = Elements List - list page links, headings, landmarks

### VoiceOver Hints & Tricks

When browsing the internet, take advantage of the ‘rotor’ wheel which allows you to view only the links, headings, form controls, etc. on the page.
To engage the 'rotor,’ use two fingers spaced apart and twist them at the same time in a clockwise motion (as though you were twisting a dial)
